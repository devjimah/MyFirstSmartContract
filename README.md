SimpleStorage Smart Contract Project
A basic smart contract that stores and manages favorite numbers and people's information using Solidity.
What This Project Does
This contract can:

Store your favorite number
Keep track of multiple favorite numbers
Store people's names and their favorite numbers
Switch between Active and Inactive states

Features I Added
1. Basic Storage

Store a single favorite number
Get the stored favorite number
Check if your number is greater than another number

2. Lists and Data Storage

Store multiple favorite numbers in a list
Store people's information (name + favorite number)
Keep track of how many numbers and people are stored

3. Contract States

Turn the contract ON (Active)
Turn the contract OFF (Inactive)
Check if the contract is ON or OFF

Challenges I Faced
Problem: Making sure data was stored correctly
Solution: Added functions to check stored values
Problem: Organizing different types of data
Solution: Used structs to group related information together
Problem: Keeping track of contract state
Solution: Used enums to make state management simple
